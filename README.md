# More Awesome Lists

This is a list of "awesome" lists. An awesome list is a list of resources and starting points for a particular topic.

I made this repo to be a more inclusive  version of [sindresorhus's awesome list](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). There are no strict requirements for contributions. As long as your list is marginally useful and the description disruptive, I'll accept your PR.
