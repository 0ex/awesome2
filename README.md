## Meta

"Awesome" lists are curated collections of resources on some particular topic, which can
be broad like "Math" or very specific like "Quantum Machine Learning".

They are useful for as starting points for beginners and to help experts discover the
landscape of available resources, which can be
tutorials, papers, tools, books, websites, libraries, software, products,
open source projects, etc.

This is a top-level list, which means it contains links to other "awesome" lists.
The goals of *this* top-level list are:

- be extensive: cover every topic which someone cared enough about to create a good list.
- be inclusive: no irrelevant requirements for submission, like specific formatting.
- highlight the best maintained list on each topic; our suggested starting point.
- include alternatives at the end of each description, for those digging deeper.

**Other Top-level Lists**
